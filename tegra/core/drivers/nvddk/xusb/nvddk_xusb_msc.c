//********Mass Storage Class and Bulk Transport only related functions********
//For BOT protocol: http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbmassbulk_10.pdf
//For command related details
//          refer to http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbmass-ufi10.pdf

//Data Transfer Conditions:-
//The host indicates the expected transfer in the CBW using the Direction bit
//and the dCBWDataTransferLength field. The device then determines the actual
//direction and data transfer length. The device responds by transferring data,
//STALLing endpoints when specified, and returning the appropriate CSW.

//Command Transport:-
//The host shall send each CBW, which contains a command block, to the device
//via the Bulk-Out endpoint. The CBW shall start on a packet boundary and end as
//a short packet with exactly 31 (1Fh) bytes transferred. The device shall
//indicate a successful transport of a CBW by accepting (ACKing) the CBW.
//If the CBW is not valid (see 6.6.1)or If the host detects a STALL of the
//Bulk-Out endpoint during command transport, the host shall respond with
//a Reset Recovery

//Data Transport:-
//All data transport shall begin on a packet boundary. The host shall attempt to
//transfer the exact number of bytes to or from the device as specified by the
//dCBWDataTransferLength and the Direction bit. To report an error before data
//transport completes and to maximize data integrity, the device may terminate
//the command by STALLing the endpoint in use (the Bulk-In endpoint during data
//in, the Bulk-Out endpoint during data out).

//Status Transport:-
//The device shall send each CSW to the host via the Bulk-In endpoint.
//The CSW shall start on a packet boundary and end as a short packet with
//exactly 13 (Dh) bytes transferred. The CSW indicates to the host the status of
//the execution of the command block from the corresponding CBW. The
//dCSWDataResidue field indicates how much of the data transferred is to be
//considered processed or relevant. The host shall ignore any data received
//beyond that which is relevant
//-The host shall perform a Reset Recovery when Phase Error status is returned in the CSW.
//-For Reset Recovery the host shall issue in the following order: :
//(a) a Bulk-Only Mass Storage Reset
//(b) a Clear Feature HALT to the Bulk-In endpoint
//(c) a Clear Feature HALT to the Bulk-Out endpoint

//Host/Device Data Transfers

//A Bulk-Only Protocol transaction begins with the host sending a CBW to the
//device and attempting to make the appropriate data transfer (In, Out or none).
//The device receives the CBW, checks and interprets it, attempts to satisfy the
//host's request, and returns status via a CSW

//Valid and Meaningful CBW
//------------------------
//The host communicates its intent to the device through the CBW. The device
//performs two verifications on every CBW received. First, the device verifies
//that what was received is a valid CBW. Next, the device determines if the data
//within the CBW is meaningful. The device shall not use the contents of the
//dCBWTag in any way other than to copy its value to the dCSWTag of
//the corresponding CSW

//The device shall consider the CBW valid when:
// The CBW was received after the device had sent a CSW or after a reset,
// the CBW is 31 (1Fh) bytes in length,
// and the dCBWSignature is equal to 43425355h.
//The device shall consider the contents of a valid CBW meaningful when:
// no reserved bits are set,
// the bCBWLUN contains a valid LUN supported by the device,
// and both bCBWCBLength and the content of the CBWCB are in accordance with
// bInterfaceSubClass


//Valid and Meaningful CSW
//-------------------------
//The device generally communicates the results of its attempt to satisfy the
//hosts request through the CSW. The host performs two verifications on every CSW
//received. First, the host verifies that what was received is a valid CSW Next,
//the host determines if the data within the CSW is meaningful Valid CSW
//The host shall consider the CSW valid when:
// the CSW is 13 (Dh) bytes in length,
// and the dCSWSignature is equal to 53425355h,
// the dCSWTag matches the dCBWTag from the corresponding CBW
//Meaningful CSW
//The host shall consider the contents of the CSW meaningful when:
//either the bCSWStatus value is 00h or 01h and the dCSWDataResidue is less than
//or equal to dCBWDataTransferLength..or the bCSWStatus value is 02h.


//Device Error Handling
//----------------------
//The device may not be able to fully satisfy the host's request. At the point
//when the device discovers that it cannot fully satisfy the request, there may
//be a Data-In or Data-Out transfer in progress on the bus, and the host may have
//other pending requests. The device may cause the host to terminate such
//transfers by STALLing the appropriate pipe. Please note that whether or not a
//STALL handshake actually appears on the bus depends on whether or not there is a
//transfer in progress at the point in time when the device is ready to STALL the pipe.

//Host Error Handling
//----------------------
//If the host receives a CSW which is not valid, then the host shall perform a
//Reset Recovery. If the host receives a CSW which is not meaningful, then the
//host may perform a Reset Recovery

//Error Classes
//---------------------
//In every transaction between the host and the device, there are four possible
//classes of errors. These classes are not always independent of each other and
//may occur at any time during the transaction

//1)CBW Not Valid
//If the CBW is not valid, the device shall STALL the Bulk-In pipe. Also, the
//device shall either STALL the Bulk-Out pipe, or the device shall accept and
//discard any Bulk-Out data. The device shall maintain this state until a Reset Recovery

//2)Internal Device Error
//The device may detect an internal error for which it has no reliable means of
//recovery other than a reset. The device shall respond to such conditions by:
//either STALLing any data transfer in progress and returning a Phase Error status
//(bCSWStatus = 02h)
//(or) STALLing all further requests on the Bulk-In and the Bulk-Out pipes
//until a Reset Recovery.

//3)Host/Device Disagreements
//After recognizing that a CBW is valid and meaningful, and in the absence of
//internal errors, the device may detect a condition where it cannot meet the
//hosts expectation for data transfer, as indicated by the Direction bit of the
//bmCBWFlags field and the dCBWDataTransferLength field of the CBW. In some of
//these cases, the device may require a reset to recover. In these cases, the
//device shall return Phase Error status (bCSWStatus = 02h)

//4)Command Failure
//After recognizing that a CBW is valid and meaningful, the device may still
//fail in its attempt to satisfy the command. The device shall report this
//condition by returning a Command Failed status (bCSWStatus = 01h)
