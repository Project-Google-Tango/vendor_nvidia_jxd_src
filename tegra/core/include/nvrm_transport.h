 * pass messages across a lower level connection (generally between
 * processors).

 */

/** @defgroup nvrm_transport RM Transport API
 *
 * The Transport API defines a simple protocol through which clients and
 * services may connect and communicate--normally, though not necessarily,
 * across separate processors.  Clients to this interface mostly include
 * audio-visual applications whose code may reside on either the MPCore or AVP
 * processors.  These applications (and there could be many concurrently) may
 * utilize this transport API to synchronize their operations.  How the
 * Transport API shepherds messages through these connections is not visible to
 * the client.
 *
 * To setup a new connection, both the client and the service must open a port
 * (whose name is agreed upon before compile-time).  The service waits for a
 * client to connect; this "handshake" allows a connection to be established.
 * Once a client has established a connection with the service, they may send
 * and receive messages.
