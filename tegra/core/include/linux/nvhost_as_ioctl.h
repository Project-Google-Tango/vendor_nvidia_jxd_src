 * /dev/nvhost-as-* devices

 * space.  nvhost channels (for the same module) can then be bound to such an
 * address space to define the addresses it has access to.
 *
 * Once a nvhost channel has been bound to an address space it cannot be
 * unbound.  There is no support for allowing an nvhost channel to change from
 * one address space to another (or from one to none).
 *
 * As long as there is an open device file to the address space, or any bound
 * nvhost channels it will be valid.  Once all references to the address space
 * are removed the address space is deleted.
