 * It provides the APIs to access the NAND flash physically (in raw block number
 * and page numbers) and logically (in logical block number through 
 * block device interface).
 * It does not support any software ECC algorithms. It makes use of hardware ECC 
 * features supported by NAND Controller for validating the data.
 * It supports accessing NAND flash devices in interleave mode.
