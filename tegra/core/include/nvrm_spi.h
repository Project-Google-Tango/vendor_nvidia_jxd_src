/**
 * Performs an Spi controller read and write simultaneously in master mode.
 * This apis is only supported if the handle is open in master mode.
 *
 * Every Spi transaction is by definition a simultaneous read and write transaction, so
 * there are no separate APIs for read versus write. However, if you only need
 * to do a read or write, this API allows you to declare that you are not
 * interested in the read data, or that the write data is not of interest.
 * If only read is required then client can pass the NULL pointer to the
 * pWriteBuffer. Zeros will be sent in this case.
 * Similarly, if client wants to send data only then he can pass the
 * pReadBuffer as NULL.
 * If Read and write is required and he wants to first send the command and
 * then want to read the response, then he need to send both the valid pointer
 * read and write. In this case the bytesRequested will be the sum of the
 * send command size and response size. The size of the pReadBuffer and
 * pWriteBuffer should be equal to the bytes requetsed.
 * E.g. Client want to send the 4byte command first and the wants to read the
 * 4 byte response, then he need a 8 byte pWriteBuffer and 8 byte pReadBuffer.
 * He will fill the first 4 byte of pWriteBuffer with the command which he
 * wants to send. After calling this api, he needs to ignore the first 4 bytes
 * and use the next 4 byte as valid response data in the pReadBuffer.
 *
 * This is a blocking API. It will returns when all the data has been transferred
 * over the pins of the SOC (the transaction).
 *
 * Several Spi transactions may be performed in a single call to this API, but
 * only if all of the transactions are to the same chip select and have the same
 * packet size.
 *
 * Transaction sizes from 1 to 32 bits are supported. However, all of the
 * packets are byte-aligned in memory. Like, if packetBitLength is 12 bit
 * then client needs the 2 byte for the 1 packet. New packets start from the
 * new bytes e.g. byte0 and byte1 contain the first packet and byte2 and byte3
 * will contain the second packets.
 *
 * To perform one transaction, the BytesRequested argument should be:
 *
 *   (PacketSizeInBits + 7)/8
 *
 * To perform n transactions, BytesRequested should be:
 *
 *   n*((PacketSizeInBits + 7)/8)
 *
 * Within a given
 * transaction with the packet size larger than 8 bits, the bytes are stored in
 * order of the MSB (most significant byte) first.
 * The Packet is formed with the first Byte will be in MSB and then next byte
 * will be in the  next MSB towards the LSB.
 *
 * For the example, if One packet need to be send and its size is the 20 bit
 * then it will require the 3 bytes in the pWriteBuffer and arrangement of the
 * data	 are as follows:
 * The packet is 0x000ABCDE (Packet with length of 20 bit).
 * pWriteBuff[0] = 0x0A
 * pWriteBuff[1] = 0xBC
 * pWtriteBuff[2] = 0xDE
 *
 * The most significant bit will be transmitted first i.e. bit20 is transmitted
 * first and bit 0 will be transmitted last.
 *
 * If the transmitted packet (command + receive data) is more than 32 like 33 and
 * want to transfer in the single call (CS should be active) then it can be transmitted
 * in following way:
 * The transfer is command(8 bit)+Dummy(1bit)+Read (24 bit) = 33 bit of transfer.
 * - Send 33 bit as 33 byte and each byte have the 1 valid bit, So packet bit length = 1 and
 * bytes requested = 33.
 * NvU8 pSendData[33], pRecData[33];
 *  pSendData[0] = (Comamnd >>7) & 0x1;
 *  pSendData[1] = (Command >> 6)& 0x1;
 * ::::::::::::::
 * pSendData[8] = DummyBit;
 * pSendData[9] to pSendData[32] = 0;
 * Call NvRmSpiTransaction(hRmSpi,SpiPinMap,ChipSelect,ClockSpeedInKHz,pRecData, pSendData, 33,1);
 * Now You will get the read data from pRecData[9] to pRecData[32] on bit 0 on each byte.
 *
 * - The 33 bit transfer can be also done as 11 byte and each byte have the 3 valid bits.
 * This need to rearrange the command in the pSendData in such a way that each byte have the
 * 3 valid bits.
 * NvU8 pSendData[11], pRecData[11];
 *  pSendData[0] = (Comamnd >>4) & 0x7;
 *  pSendData[1] = (Command >> 1)& 0x7;
 *  pSendData[2] = (((Command)& 0x3) <<1) | DummyBit;
 * pSendData[3] to pSendData[10] = 0;
 *
 * Call NvRmSpiTransaction(hRmSpi,SpiPinMap,ChipSelect,ClockSpeedInKHz,pRecData, pSendData, 11,3);
 * Now You will get the read data from pRecData[4] to pRecData[10] on lower 3 bits on each byte.
 *
 * Similarly the 33 bit transfer can also be done as 6 byte and each 2 bytes contain the 11 valid bits.
 * Call NvRmSpiTransaction(hRmSpi,SpiPinMap,ChipSelect,ClockSpeedInKHz,pRecData, pSendData, 6,11);
 *
 * pReadBuffer and pWriteBuffer may be the same pointer, in which case the
 * write data is destroyed as we read in the read data. Unless they are
 * identical pointers, however, pReadBuffer and pWriteBuffer must not overlap.
 *
 * @param hOdmSpi The Spi handle allocated in a call to NvOdmSpiOpen().
 * @param SpiPinMap For SPI master-mode controllers which are being multiplexed across
 *        multiple pin mux configurations, this specifies which pin mux configuration
 *        should be used for the transaction.  Must be 0 when the ODM pin mux query
 *        specifies a non-multiplexed configuration for the controller.
 * @param ChipSelectId The chip select Id on which device is connected.
 * @param ClockSpeedInKHz The clock speed in KHz on which device can communicate.
 * @param pReadBuffer A pointer to buffer to be filled in with read data. If this
 *     pointer is NULL, the read data will be discarded.
 * @param pWriteBuffer A pointer to a buffer from which to obtain write data. If this
 *     pointer is NULL, the write data will be all zeros.

 * 2. ACPU then send the signal to the CCPU to send the SPICLK (by activating
 * the SPI_INT) and start the transaction. CCPU get this signal and start sending
 * SPICLK.
 * 3. ACPU will call the NvRmSpiGetTransactionData() to get the data/information
 * about the transaction.
