 * @sa NvOdmSdramControllerConfig structure description for the format of each

 * @sa NvOdmSdramControllerConfigAdv structure description for the format of

 * 
 * @note The maximum scaled SDRAM frequency Fmax is limited by boot configuration
 * of memory:
 * <pre>
 *    PLL - PLLM: Fmax = (PLLM boot output frequency)/2 
 * </pre>
 * The minimum scaled SDRAM frequency is fixed as
 * <pre>
 *    Fmin = 12MHz
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par SDRAM Frequency Ladders
 * 
 * Revision 1.0 - Only entries for Fmax and evenly
 * divided from Fmax SDRAM frequencies above Fmin are used by DVFS (e.g. Fmax,
 * Fmax/2, Fmax/4, Fmax/6, etc). All other entries are ignored. Hence, one
 * table can contain entries for all different PLLM configurations used for the
 * particular ODM platform, and DVFS will automatically select the frequency ladder
 * based on the boot settings. For example, the table can mix entries for Fmax
 * = 166MHz ladder (166/83/41.5/27.6) and Fmax = 133MHz ladder (133/66.5/33.25/
 * 21.16). The table is not required to be sorted in any way.
 * 
 * Revision 2.0 - Only entries for Fmax and .... 
 * ladders 
 * 
 * The memory controller DVFS is enabled, provided all of the following
 * conditions are true:
 * - This function returns a non-NULL pointer to the table.
 * - The table includes an entry for Fmax SDRAM frequency.
 * - The table includes an entry for boot SDRAM frequency (if boot configuration
 * utilizes EMC divider to set initial SDRAM frequency different from Fmax).
 * This condition is applicable only to Revision 1.0 configuration.
 * If any of the above conditions are not met, memory controller DVFS will be
 * disabled and boot SDRAM configuration is preserved during run time.
 * 
 * @param pEntries A pointer to a variable which this function sets to the
 * number of entires in the configuration table.
 * @param pRevision A pointer to a variable which this function sets to the
 * revision number of the configuration table entry structure.
 *
 * @return A const pointer to the configuration table, or NULL if EMC DVFS
 *   is disabled.
