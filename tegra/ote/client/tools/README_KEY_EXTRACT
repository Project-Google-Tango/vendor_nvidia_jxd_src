This is the README for version 2 of "eks_extract_keys.py".
"eks_extract_keys.py" is for extracting a key at a particular index in the
encrypted key storage (EKS) partition file. The EKS partition file to be
encrypted is specified as an argument.
This version will support files created with the old version of
"eks_encrypt_keys.py".
NOTE: The new version of "eks_extract_keys.py" will not support extraction of
keys from files created with the older version of "eks_encrypt_keys.py".

How to extract key from a device

1. boot the device with recovery mode

2. read key partition from the device using "nvflash --read N <filename>
--bl bootloader.bin --go". N should be id of EKS partion which is defined
in flash.cfg
Ex)
$ cd $OUT
$ $TOP/out/host/linux-x86/bin/nvflash --read 5 "my_eks.dat" --bl bootloader.bin
--go

3. run eks_extract_key.py with the file above, SBK, index of the key slot, and
algorithm which is used to encrypt the key.
for "--algo", it should match with the argument for algorithm supported by
openssl. Please check OPENSSL

Example:

We want to extract wv key box in eks, and SBK value is:
secure_boot_key_0 0x0c0d0e0f
secure_boot_key_1 0x08090a0b
secure_boot_key_2 0x04050607
secure_boot_key_3 0x00010203

The command is:
$ python eks_extract_key.py --sbk=0f0e0d0c0b0a09080706050403020100
--eks=eks.dat --index=5 --algo=aes-128-cbc

4. the python tool will generate "Key_<index>.dat" file if the key is
available in the slot

5. the python tool will also generate "algorithm_file.dat" and
"permissions_file.dat" files if version 2 is detected. For version 1,
this informationw will not be attempted to be extracted
