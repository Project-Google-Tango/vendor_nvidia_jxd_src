Simple example application using the new Presentation API in android 4.2.

Usage:
- Connect HDMI (or some other external display)
   * If you don't have an external display, you can use a simulated display from android developer options.
   * [Settings] -> [Developer options] -> [Simulate secondary displays]
-  Start the application

[Select Video] Opens up a filechooser to select a video for our presentation.

[Play Video] Starts video playback, does nothing if there is no video selected.

[Pause Video] Pauses video playback.

[Hide system UI] Hides the statusbar and other system UI elements from both displays.

[Switch HDMI Mode] Toggles between MIRRORING and CINEMA mode. 
   * Mirroring displays a complete copy of the internal screen on the external screen. 
   * Cinema mode displays the video on external screen and controls (and system UI) on internal.


Known Issues:
- There seems to be a bug in the android framework when you disconnect your external display during a presentation.
  This doesn't always lead to crash, but it does produce unhandled exceptions which may lead to the mediaplayer to crash.
