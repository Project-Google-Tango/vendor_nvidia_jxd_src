To run the test, type the following from the adb shell prompt:

nvaudio_test [usecase] [platform]
Currently supported usecase is voice_call, headset_detection
and loopback
Currently supported platforms are pluto and enterprise
Return Value: 0 for success and negative value for failure

Examples:

Eg 1:
nvaudio_test voice_call pluto
command will test the voice call for pluto board

The test simulates voice call and compares the audio cluster
register dump with a reference golden dump and if the register
dump matches then the test is successfull and return value is 0
else the test fails and returns negative value

Eg 2:
nvaudio_test headset_detection pluto
command will test headset detection for pluto board

This test triggers an alsa control to set switch state to
headset available, and then it starts the Music Player and
checks via an alsa control whether audio is routed to headset.
If test is successfull return value is 0 else return value
is negative.

Eg 3:
nvaudio_test loopback pluto
command will test loopback for pluto board

This test starts recoding using tinycap, sets the ahub level
loopback and then launches the Music Player. So the playback data
get recorderd via the tinycap app since loopback is set. The
recorded data is compared with a golden snippet of Music which
is taken from the played back data. Comparison is carried out using
a moving window and calculating sum of absolute difference (SAD) at
every point. A minimum SAD of 0 is the matching criteria i.e bit-exact
matching since we are doing a digital loopback.
