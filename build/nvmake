Please setup your environment as follows:

export P4ROOT=<your_p4_root>
export TOP=<your_top_dir>
export TEGRA_TOP=\${TOP}/vendor/nvidia/tegra
. build/envsetup.sh

Next, run \"choosecombo\" in order to select your configuration.

choosecombo

Use your board name (e.g. \"cardhu\") as the product when asked.
For use in shell scripts, you can give the choices as arguments, e.g.

choosecombo 1 2 cardhu eng

If you prefer, you can use a buildspec.mk file instead of choosecombo.
This is what we used to do with Froyo.  buildspec.mk is useful if
you rarely change your build setup.  Just copy the sample from
\$TOP/build/buildspec.mk.default to \$TOP/buildspec.mk and edit.

To build the complete image, say

m dev

or plain

m

To build your module only, say

mm

in the module directory.  For parallel builds, use convenience
commands \"mp\" and \"mmp\".

To nvflash the board, use

flash

In case of issues, please fix, or file a bug with Mobile_Build_System .
