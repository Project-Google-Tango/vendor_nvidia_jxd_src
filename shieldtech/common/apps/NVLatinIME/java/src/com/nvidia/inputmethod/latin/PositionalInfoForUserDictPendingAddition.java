 * Holder class for data about a word already committed but that may still be edited.

 * suggestion, a dialog is presented to give a chance to edit the word before it is actually
 * registered as a user dictionary word. If the word is actually modified, the IME needs to
 * go back and replace the word that was committed with the amended version.
 * The word we need to replace with will only be known after it's actually committed, so

     * After the user validated the word being added, the IME has to replace the old version
     * (which has been committed in the text view) with the amended version if it's different.
     * This method tries to do that, but may fail because the IME is not yet ready to do so -
     * for example, it is still waiting for the new string, or it is waiting to return to the text
     * view in which the amendment should be made. In these cases, we should keep the data
     * and wait until all conditions are met.
     * This method returns true if the replacement has been successfully made and this data
     * can be forgotten; it returns false if the replacement can't be made yet and we need to
     * keep this until a later time.
     * The IME knows about the actual word being added through a callback called by the
     * user dictionary facility of the device. When this callback comes, the keyboard may still
     * be connected to the edition dialog, or it may have already returned to the original text
     * field. Replacement has to work in both cases.
     * Accordingly, this method is called at two different points in time : upon getting the
     * event that a new word was added to the user dictionary, and upon starting up in a
     * new text field.
